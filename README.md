## Design Phase Division

### Phase One: Requirements Analysis and Architecture Design

**Design Approach**:

1. Analyze common requirements of web applications for SQLite databases: connection management, table structure
   operations, data CRUD, transaction support, etc.
2. Define core and extended functionalities of the package.
3. Design a modular architecture to ensure clear responsibilities for each component.
4. Establish API interface specifications for usability and consistency.  
   **Completion Criteria**:

- Functional requirements document
- Modular architecture diagram
- API interface definition document

### Phase Two: Core Module Design and Implementation

**Design Approach**:

1. **Connection Management Module**: Implement connection pool management with multi-threaded secure access.
2. **Table Management Module**: Provide table creation, modification, and deletion operations.
3. **Data Operations Module**: Implement CRUD operations and basic query functionality.
4. **Transaction Management Module**: Offer transaction support to ensure data consistency.  
   **Completion Criteria**:

- Basic implementation code for each module
- Module unit tests
- Interface documentation examples

### Phase Three: Advanced Feature Implementation

**Design Approach**:

1. **Query Builder**: Provide chained-call interfaces for constructing complex queries.
2. **Data Migration Tool**: Support database version management and migration.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement query caching, index optimization, and other features.
4. **Data Type Mapping**: Enhance mapping between Python types and SQLite types.  
   **Completion Criteria**:

- Advanced feature implementation code
- Performance test reports
- Feature usage examples

### Phase Four: Testing and Optimization

**Design Approach**:

1. Write comprehensive unit tests covering all functional points.
2. Conduct integration tests simulating real-world web application scenarios.
3. Perform performance testing and optimization to ensure stability under high concurrency.
4. Conduct security audits to prevent SQL injection and other security issues.  
   **Completion Criteria**:

- Test coverage report (>90%)
- Performance benchmark results
- Security audit report

### Phase Five: Packaging and Documentation

**Design Approach**::

1. Write detailed usage documentation and API references.
2. Create sample code and tutorials.
3. Configure packaging scripts (setup.py/pyproject.toml).
4. Prepare for PyPI release.  
   **Completion Criteria**:

- Complete documentation website
- Packaging configuration files
- Sample code repository
